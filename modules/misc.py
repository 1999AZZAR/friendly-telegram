The technology is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of cell towers most of the signal will go over a typical user‚Äôs head. There's also Mukesh Ambani‚Äôs omniscient outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Indian literature, for instance. The users understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this technology, to realize that they're not just powerful- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike reliance jio truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Mukesh‚Äôs existencial catchphrase \"does this roms supports volte????‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Mukesh Ambani‚Äôs genius unfolds itself on their phone screens. What fools... how I pity them. üòÇ And yes by the way, I DO have a reliance jio tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.
